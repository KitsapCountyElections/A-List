# A-List
This repository contains the source code for the A List app.

A List is an Android app to automatically check in to a Southwest flight. The passenger enters flight details beforehand, and 24 hours before the flight, the app checks the passenger in. The hope is that this increases the probability of getting an A tier seat. Some more development is ongoing, and any input is always appreciated.

## Building the app
I have most recently compiled this app with Android Studio 1.1.0.  Simply import the project into your workspace and AS should start building everything. If you do not have Android Studio, you can get it [here] (https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
